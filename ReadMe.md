This is an encryption, a decryption, and a key generator for RSA-2048 encryption.

The test Functions file is to test algorithms and see instant results. In creating an industrial strength program, it will
require hours to decrypt and review the results.

The message size needs to be less P + Q - 1 bits.

This program ensures that you can encrypt any given file in a format of .TXT.

Key generator: Creates 3 text files with the essential keys for encryption and decryption.

Encrypt: Will encrypt a given string either from a text file or inputted. Also, generating a file with the encrypted message and display
it.

Decrypt: Will decrypt from a file, and generates a new file with the decrypted message and display it.

To run this program, you need Python Interpreter installed. This given code is written in Python 3.6. Be sure to, include all files of
the program in the same folder.

After adding additional features to the program, now RSA-2048 encryption, supports encryption and decryption with any file format, With 
minding the extension of the file after successfully processing.
